#Required Data Set: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
  This is a data set from Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering. It is one of the most cited COVID resources
  
Required Packages:
1. dplyr (Expands many base functions)
2. tidyverse (For plotting/many many functions)
3. lubridate (For manipulating time)
4. readr (For quicker importation of the data)
5. janitor (For cleaning many of the data frames up)


Purpose: This repository allows you to have access to the JHU data (except WHO SitReps as there are tooooo many) to manipulate personally while also being able to view my analysis.

Reproduce: To get a nice and tidy .html file, you can simply knit the Report.Rmd file to HTML!
